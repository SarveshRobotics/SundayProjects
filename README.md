#### Projects which have only one purpose: fun!

I remember that during my sophomore year in Mechanical Engineering, I initiated a routine of doing small-fun projects to just have fun! But since there is almost always something on the necessary-to-do list, I lost track of those projects.

I am now a Roboticist! I recently graduated with a Masters degree from the University of Maryland. Now, I have more in-depth knowledge of topics to actually have fun! I am holding this repo to remind myself, time and again, that it's important to have fun!

I will be adding to this repository, small projects that can apart from utilizing technical concepts make enthusiasts like me realize how fun learning can be! So here is the list of projects I intend to complete:

- [x] *2D Landscapes*
- [ ] Creating Avatars - AR (Halfway Through it, will be posting soon)
- [x] *Virtual Canvas*
- [ ] . . .

Stay Tuned!

Thank You!!!
